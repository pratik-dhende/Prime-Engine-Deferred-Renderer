# Deferred Rendering Pipeline
- Added support for the `Deferred Rendering` pipeline in a `proprietary` game engine, Prime Engine, as one of my final projects for the `CSCI 522 Game Engine Development` course at the `University of Southern California`, earning an exceptional score of `110/100`.
- Employed `RenderDoc` for in-depth graphics debugging and performance profiling.

## Technological Stack
`C++ • DirectX11 • HLSL • RenderDoc`

## Motivation
- Develop a solid understanding of the Deferred Rendering pipeline.
- Enhance proficiency in working with the DirectX11 graphics pipeline.
